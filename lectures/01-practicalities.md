## Journey as an Educator

Everybody here has experience as a **learner** but this might be the start of your journey as an **educator**.

Or you might have had some experiences before... (maybe not as a job!)

Examples: piano teaching kids, coaching soccer team, homework help for highschoolers, leading a club or society  

**Who here has had a teaching experience before?**

## Charles' Teaching Journey

- 2003: (in highschool): helping out percussionists in junior concert band
- 2005: First work as a private percussion/drumset teacher
- 2007: (maybe?): Tutor for MATH1013/14 at ANU (!)
- 2014-2016: Tutor and Casual Lecturer at ANU (COMP1720, MUSI3309, COMP2100, COMP2300)
- 2019: Lecturer at ANU (COMP2300/6300, COMP1720/6720, COMP4350/8350)
- 2022: Developed study programs for Human Centred and Creative Computing (HCCC-MAJ, HCCC-MIN, HCCC-SPEC, HCCM-SPEC)
- 2025: New this year! Training new CSAs, teaching COMP3900/6390.

## Teaching Values

I'm a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy where we follow a [Professional Standards Framework](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/teaching-and-learning/psf) one part of this is 5 _values_:

- **V1**: respect individual learners and diverse groups of learners
- **V2**: promote engagement in learning and equity of opportunity for all to reach their potential
- **V3**: use scholarship, or research, or professional learning, or other evidence-informed approaches as a basis for effective practice
- **V4**: respond to the wider context in which higher education operates, recognising implications for practice
- **V5**: collaborate with others to enhance practice

## Computing Education

## What's tutoring like?

- **Teaching labs:** standing at the front speaking to a whole class, helping individuals with work, answering questions, listening to problems and issues, helping students learn!
- **Marking assessments:** evaluating work (what have students learned?), explaining evaluations, writing feedback, explaining reasoning
- **Meeting with course convenors and other tutors:** going to meetings, understanding duties and tasks, providing ideas/info, incorporating feedback
- **Filling in timesheets, doing admin:** navigating ANU websites, understanding rights/responsibilities at work, asking for help

## Timesheets and hours

Every two weeks you will need to fill in a timesheet on HORUS (the ANU HR website). You won't get paid until you fill in the timesheet and your manager (course convenor) approves it!

Tricky because of way ANU accounts for teaching hours through "earnings codes" where 1 unit of the code may include more than 1 hour of work.

- T42: Marking: 1-to-1 ratio
- T44: "Other required activity": 1-to-1 ratio
- T21: **Teaching** "Supplementary / scaffolded form of delivery" (that is, tutorials or labs): 1-to-3 ratio (1 hour teaching + 2 hours of "associated working time")
- T23: **Repeat Teaching** "Supplementary / scaffolded form of delivery" (1 hour teaching + 1 hour associated working time)

[ANU Academic Casual Sessional Rates](https://services.anu.edu.au/human-resources/salaries-benefits/academic-casual-sessional-rates)

## What is associated working time?

[S2.5---S2.6](https://services.anu.edu.au/human-resources/enterprise-agreement/schedule-2-casual-sessional-academic-activities-and-rates)

- Preparing of teaching activities
- Contemporaneous marking
- Administration directly associated with a teaching activity
- Face to face consultation immediately prior to and following a face to face teaching activity
- Online consultation (e.g. email, messages, forums) immediately prior to and following an online teaching activity
- Attendance at meetings specifically for the purpose of assisting the CSA staff member to prepare for their teaching activity

## Why do we do it this way?

- It's in the Enterprise Agreement
- Provides guarantees of hours throughout the semester
- Protects casual staff against unfair requests from academics (e.g., "You'll have to attend the lecture to find out what to teach! No you don't get paid for that!!")


## Safety



## Where to get help 

- Other tutors: course team / communication channels (varies by course)
- Convenor (your direct manager)
- School of Computing front desk (CSIT Level 3 or <admin.comp@anu.edu.au>)
- Peter Hoefner - Associate Director (Education) in School of Computing: <peter.hoefner@anu.edu.au>

## Working with convenors
