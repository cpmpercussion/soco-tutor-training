author: Dr Charles Martin

## Plan for this session

1. Setting out the problem to be solved – how to support educators to teach in an inclusive way to a diverse student cohort
2. Describe some of the things universities have tried.
3. Get tables to list all the things they can think of that could be tried / have been tried.
4. Group discussion to ideate on some these suggestions. 

## Big Questions

The broad goal: what teacher development strategies can help make computing education inclusive?

1. For engaged colleagues: what resources and measures can we suggest?

2. For skeptics: how can we bring them on side?

## Why think about this?

- _Teachers_ in higher education often have broad autonomy
- Course convenors/lecturers/unit coordinators often in charge of:
    - content, learning activities, assessment
    - decision maker on some types of adjustments and special considerations
    - sets tone for learning environment

## Example: Tutor Training at ANU

ANU Centre for Learning and Teaching provided tutor training for computing until 2024.

I stepped in to re-design tutor training for our college (~90 tutors in 2025).
25% of the content is inclusive teaching practice:

1. what is inclusion?
2. why does it matter?
3. what can **you** (a casual) do about it?

Adapted strategies from [UniReadyToolkit (link)](https://unireadytoolkit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Inclusive-teaching-guide.pdf) to make sense for tutors (in closest contact with tutors).

## Task 1: What have we tried?

The idea of this task is to list measures and resources that can be used to develop teachers to support equity, diversity and **inclusion** in education.

Rules of engagement: This is about developing teaching staff, less about measures in policy at department/faculty level.

## Task 2: Rank the measures


## Task 3: Bringing Skeptics

## Task 4: Top Kool-Aid measures

## Attendance 1

In your table, discuss ideas for encouraging attendance in your courses, or courses in our school.

Aim for 15 ideas (one Post-It per idea).

Be prepared to share 3 with the room at the end.

Goal is very broad range of tactics!

Be ambitious, chaotic, ruthless, understanding, etc.

Can include ideas you have/haven’t tried, would/wouldn’t do, evidence supported or not.
Can encompass things you could do now or would require course design.
Don’t worry about resources/costs!
Don’t worry about what students might think!
Don’t worry about ANU policy!
Weird and entertaining ideas encouraged!
Only limitations is all ideas will be shared with the school.

## Attendance 2


Do this in Miro – QR code for link!
Each table: share your top tactics (must be unique!) and we will get them on Miro for discussion.
You can start by putting your top tactic on Miro (follow QR code!)
Discussion questions:
Who is responsible for change?
What would it take to make it a reality?
Would it be effective?
Are there disadvantages?

At the end: Collect all the ideas and bring them together to document.
