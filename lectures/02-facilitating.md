# Facilitating Learning

## Facilitating Learning!

This is really the main job of a **tutor**. (or is it?)

- You're in a classroom full of motivated students
- There's materials and activities for your class prepared
- There's learning outcomes to meet

How do we get the students to _learn_?

## Learning outcomes

In this session we will:

- _Identify_ the difference between instructing and facilitating
- _Practise_ new facilitation skills
- _Plan_ and _practise_ questions to guide learning

## Task: Your Tutorial Experiences (5mins)

Think of a time you had:

- a good tutorial experience
- a disappointing tutorial experience

Discuss with your group and find one example of each (one good, one bad) to share.

## Approaches to learning

![](img/M2_5.jpg)

You are going to a [video](https://vimeo.com/506981439/3fcaf2ac8c) demonstrating a learning activity. 
Before you watch, consider the focus questions below.

- What is the objective of the activity?
- What does the learner have to do?
- What are the rules and conditions?

## Thinking about roles

Consider the focus questions below.

- Why is the educator called _an instructor_ in the first example?
- Why is the educator called _a facilitator_ in the second example?
- What specifically does educator _do_ in each example?
- How _effective_ do you think each approach is?

## Task thinking about the activity (5min)

Which approach do you think:

- Is quicker?
- Requires more preparation?
- Allows more learner autonomy?
- Enables the learner to apply their learning?
- Promotes deeper learning?
- Provides a more engaging experience?

Discuss in your group, and we'll discuss together in a few minutes.

## Asking questions

Consider the facilitation questions that were used in the video.

- Why were you reaching out in front of you?
- What would you do if I weren’t here?
- What do you need to do in this activity?
- Is there anything I can give you to help you?
- What would you like me to do?
- How do you know you’re going the right way?
- Where are you trying to get to?
- Can you show us what you might do with the umbrella?
- What’s underneath you? What are you standing on? Could you use that to help you?
- How would you make adjustments so you’re not tripping over anything?

## Asking questions

Facilitation questions can be used to:

- Prompt thinking and ideas
- Check understanding
- Share information with the class
- Encourage discussion
- Promote critical thinking

## Activity: Plan and prepare

Soon you are going facilitate an activity on your own.
First: work with your group to plan and prepare.

- Group 1: Question Puzzle
- Group 2: Dog Puzzle
- Group 3: Rope Puzzle

<!-- TODO: can we adjust these activities to relate to  -->

## Activity: Practice

Now you are going facilitate the activity. 
In your group, take turns to be:

- facilitator
- student
- observer

At the end of each turn, the observer provides peer feedback to the facilitator to improve.

## Dog Puzzle

How did the dog cross the river?

- A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. 
- The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. 

## Rope Puzzle

- You have 2 ropes coated in oil to help them burn.
- The ropes burn at constant rates, and each rope will take _exactly 1 hour_ to burn all the way through.
- With only a lighter to ignite the ropes, how can you measure exactly 45 minutes? 

## Question Puzzle

- I can break, I can get clogged, I can be attacked, I can be given, I can be kept, I can be crushed. Yet, I can be whole at the same time.

## The Goat Problem

Imagine a circular fence enclosing an acre of grass. A goat is inside the fence, tied to a post. How long does the rope have to be so that the goat can eat half the grass?

## Dealing with challenges

What might you do when...

- You realise your question or prompt was unclear or confusing for the student(s)?
- The student’s response is unclear?
- No one volunteers a response?
- The same student(s) keeps answering all the questions?
- Certain students never respond?
- The student’s response is not correct or what you expected?

## Coding Class Applications

Solving a coding problem can feel a bit like walking around blindfolded!

- We can use questioning to _slow_ down trying to "solve" the problem, identify resources, look for feedback, unblock thinking.
- "Is there a resource we can use to help with this problem?"
- "Is this a problem you've seen before?"
- "What is the computer telling you"
- "Is there anything you could change to find out what's happening?"
- "Where does the computer start with this code?"

Question: Does this conflict with _explicit teaching_?

## I can't get this to work!!

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    result = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    return result
```

<!-- TODO: Make this more broken. -->
Help me solve my own problem. (PS I didn't go to the lecture and neither did you.)

# Takeaways

## Facilitating effectively:

- "Ask, don’t tell."
- Design meaningful learning activities.
- Provide clear expectations, goals and desired outcomes.
- Consider what information students need and when.
- Create and provide a supportive learning environment.
- Engage students’ prior knowledge.
- Encourage the learner to **analyse** problems, **offer** solutions and **think for themselves**.
- Enable regular **reflection** on content, tasks and own learning.
- Connect current learning with future challenges and tasks.

## Questioning techniques

- Effective questioning is a skill that requires practice.
- Consider the purpose of your question.
- Plan specific questions or question sequences before class.
- Keep questions as simple as possible.
- Be prepared to clarify or rephrase your questions.
- Be supportive in responding to questions.
- Be mindful of students’ feelings.
