## Plan for this session

1. Setting out the problem to be solved – how to support educators to teach in an inclusive way to a diverse student cohort
2. Describe some of the things universities have tried.
3. Get tables to list all the things they can think of that could be tried / have been tried.
4. Group discussion to ideate on some these suggestions. 

## Big Problems

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
> our teaching staff make or break inclusion

> they don't know how to help!

> they might be inclusion skeptics ⚠️⚠️

- _Teachers_ in higher ed often have broad autonomy
- Course convenors/lecturers/unit coordinators often in charge of:
    - content, learning activities, assessment
    - decision maker on some types of adjustments and special considerations
    - sets tone for learning environment

## Big Questions

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
> what teacher development strategies can help make computing education inclusive?

1. **for engaged colleagues:** what resources and measures can we suggest?

2. **for skeptics:** how can we bring them on side?

## Accessibility vs Inclusion are related but not identical

### Accessibility (foundations)

- **remove barriers:** eliminating specific obstacles for accessing learning materials and environments
- **compliance-driven:** requirements in law and ANU policy
- **reactive:** respond to needs through accommodations and modifications (e.g., ANU EAP)

### inclusion (next steps)

- **belonging:** create environments where everybody feels valued, supported, and able to participate
- **proactive:** shape the educational experience to support all learners from the outset
- **community:** beyond accommodations to support all students

## Example: Small Class Teacher Training at ANU

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
ANU Centre for Learning and Teaching provided tutor training for computing until 2024.

I stepped in to re-design tutor training for the College of Systems and Society (~90 tutors in 2025).

1.5 hours on inclusive teaching practice:

1. what is inclusion?
2. why does it matter?
3. what can **you** (a casual) do about it?

Adapted strategies from [UniReadyToolkit (link)](https://unireadytoolkit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Inclusive-teaching-guide.pdf) to make sense for tutors.

## UniReadyToolkit Principles

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
1. know your students
2. **design inclusive curricula and assessments**
3. **embed academic literacies (e.g., hidden curricula)**
4. use diverse teaching strategies and resources
5. create inclusive classroom environment
6. embed support systems
7. **facilitate continuous reflection**

## Task 1: What have we tried with engaged colleagues?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
<!-- The idea of this task is to list measures and resources that can be used to develop teachers to support **inclusion** in education. -->

- **list 10 ideas to help implement the principles of inclusion**

<!-- The idea of this task is to list 10 measures and resources that can help staff to enact the principles of **inclusion** in education. -->

Rules: This is about developing staff, not policy at department/faculty level.

- **then:** rank the measures and tell us about the top three from each table.
:::

the principles: 

1. know your students
2. design inclusive curricula and assessments
3. embed academic literacies (e.g., hidden curricula)
4. use diverse teaching strategies and resources
5. create inclusive classroom environment
6. embed support systems
7. facilitate continuous reflection

## Heard around ANU: why could these statements be problematic?

> We supply the tools, it's up to the students to do the rest.

> All students need to read and fully understand the exercises before attending class.

> All third year CS students should be comfortable using Linux.

> You won't get an extension without a medical certificate.

> You can't use generative AI for any aspect of this course.

> Students don't understand computers anymore.

How do these statements interact with the idea of _academic standards_?

## Task 2: Engaging Skeptics Eight Ways

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **the task is to _ideate_ ways to bring skeptics on side**

we'll do a Crazy 8s design sprint.

1. fold your piece of paper into 8 sections.
2. start the 8 minute timer
3. sketch one idea in each rectangle
4. stop when the alarm goes off

## What did we learn?

Hopefully something!
