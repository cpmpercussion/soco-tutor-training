## Plan for this session

As a _student_ you have had to teach yourself. Tutoring means working with others with different backgrounds and experiences.

1. Benefits of inclusive teaching 
2. Equitable access to learning
3. Inclusion anti-patterns
4. Strategies for inclusive teaching
5. Scenario discussions

## ANU stance on inclusion

> Membership of the ANU community means committing to our institutional values, including “being a standard-bearer for equity and inclusion”. [ANU Strategic Plan 2021-2025](https://www.anu.edu.au/about/strategic-planning/anu-strategic-plan-2021-2025)

![Inclusion, equity and diversity are ANU values.](img/anu_values.png)

## Code of practice for teaching and learning 

- _Respect diversity,_ e.g., diversity of culture, religious belief, age, race, gender and other personal and group-based attributes. 
- _Recognise_ that _diversity_ of student and staff backgrounds, opinions and views _is a valuable resource_ for enhancing critical, motivated and dialogic teaching and learning.
- _Experience_ an environment that is _equitable, collegial, and responsive to the diversity of individuals.
- _Contribute_ to an environment _free from harassment, discrimination and bullying_, with access to complaint procedures which will facilitate _speedy and just resolutions._

Think-Pair-Share:

> Given that university classrooms are diverse, what opportunities and benefits does this provide?

1. Think individually (1 min)
2. Pair – discuss with a partner (1 min)
3. Share in class - Listen to participants responses (2 mins)

## Equity vs Equality

![Source: Image by Ciell via [Wikimedia Common](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Equality_vs_Equity.png)](img/equity.png){width=70%}

- **Equality**: Everyone receives the same support regardless of need.
- **Equity**: Individuals receive the support they need to achieve the desired outcomes.

## Barriers to learning

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Barriers could be: physical, sensory, mental, emotional, cognitive, cultural, social.
- Factors may lead to challenges depending on context, or only some situations.
- They may be permanent, temporary, or situational for the individual
- Inclusive teaching can help individuals with specific challenges but the assistance can extend to others as well.

Some other barriers:

- cognitive: information processing, learning speed
- sensory: classroom environment, learning activity format and presentation

## Identifying barriers to learning

Now we are going to consider some of the barriers to learning that our students may experience.

_Think-&-Share_

1. Consider the student personas provided. Use these to reflect upon the potential barriers to learning that students at ANU may experience.

2. Write down on some sticky notes (one idea per note) any barriers you can think of.

3. When everyone in your group is ready, explain your sticky notes to your group. Try to identify any common themes.

## Overcoming barriers to learning

> Consider the students you may be teaching and the permanent or temporary or situational barriers to learning that they may face.

_Reflect_: What could you do to help __reduce__, __alleviate__ or __remove__ some of these barriers in _your_ learning environment, content, materials and activities?

_Share_: Spend two minutes sharing ideas with the person next to you.

## Accessibility tools

When thinking about your materials and activities, there are a lot of accessibility situations of which you need to be aware.

Refer to the [ANU Learning and Teaching blog](https://learningandteaching.anu.edu.au/blog/) and [resources](https://learningandteaching.anu.edu.au/resources/).

# Creating inclusive learning communities

## Creating an inclusive space

_Reflect:_

> "You can have accessibility without inclusion, but not inclusion without accessibility."

## The elements of an inclusive space

Inclusive education facilitates the access, participation and success of students.

- Use inclusive language, including respect for choice.
- Allow for individual differences in how students want to access materials and participate in activities.
- Provide accessible materials, content and environments.
- Ensure students can see themselves reflected in materials and activities.

## Creating your own inclusive space

Think. Pair. Share:

- Suggest 1--3 practical changes to content, materials and activities to promote inclusion. 
- Be as specific as you can.
- Think and write each idea on a separate sticky note.
- Share your ideas with your partner.
- Place on the appropriate sheets around the room.

__Think about:__

When teaching, where could you provide diverse representation in your course materials?

How can you ensure your students can see themselves in the materials?

# Inclusion Anti-Patterns

## Inclusive teaching is not automatic.

- Our teaching is probably not inclusive enough.
- Some typical ways of working leave students out.
- We need to work hard to detect inclusion anti-patterns and to mitigate or eliminate the effects.

> Inclusive teaching is valued at CSS, that's why we are spending time on it today!

## Task: Dangerous Patterns for Inclusion (5mins)

> Can you think of any common teaching patterns that are dangerous for inclusion?

- Doesn't have to be actively hostile to be a bit less inclusive than we would hope.
- Some practices may be less-than-inclusive but necessary or desired (on balance)

Discuss as groups, and share an example from each table. 

## Heard around ANU: why are these statements problematic?

> We supply the tools, it's up to the students to do the rest.

> All students need to read and fully understand the exercises before attending class.

> All third year CS students should be comfortable using Linux.

How do these statements interact with the idea of _academic standards_?

# Strategies for Inclusive Teaching

Broadly adapted from [UniReadyToolkit (link)](https://unireadytoolkit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Inclusive-teaching-guide.pdf)

## Know your students

This will make it easier to see and respond to their needs.

If you know your students you will _want_ to help and in many cases you will _know what to do when you see it_.

## Design Inclusive Curricula

But what can _tutors_ do about this?

- help convenor by communicating course and class structures.
- signpost difficult topics for students, help scaffold them during class.
- clarify expectations for assessments, one good way: "I can't help with the assignment but THIS exercise in the lab is directly related and I CAN help with that".
- help understand *rationale*- for assessments.
- provide actionable feedback (within reason)

## Embed Academic Literacies

- Explicity teach academic conventions
- Encourage active engagement in academic texts
- Explicity teach information literacy skills

## Use diverse teaching strategies and resources

- Help students interact and engage: how can we increase collaboration and belonging in our classes?
- Incorporate real-world applications:
- Integrate accessibility into your teaching.

## Create an inclusive classroom environment

- Cultivate a positive and inclusive classroom culture
- Support goal setting and achievement
- Encourage self-reflection
- Promote positive role models

## Embed support systems

- Incorporate help seeking into classes - how can we encourage questions?
- Direct students to available support resources

## Facilitate continuous reflection

- Reflect on the effectiveness of your teaching strategies
- Elicit feedback from students.

# Scenario Discussions

Each group will have 10 minutes to work through a scenario and formulate a response to share with everybody.

- __Consider__ the scenario and __think__ about your response.
- __Pair__ with _another group member_ to share and discuss your thoughts.
- __Share__ and __discuss__ your preferred solutions with the group.

## Scenario 0 (Everybody)

_Think-Pair-Share_: You are teaching in an older building on campus. One of your students requires a walking stick for mobility purposes. In the first week, the student has alerted you to the fact and/or you have observed that to attend the class they have to climb three flights of stairs, as there is no lift available.

__Discuss:__

- What do you do?
- Who do you contact?
- What factors need to be considered here?
- What is a short-term solution?

## Scenario 1

Your classes have many international students who are in their first semester of studying in Australia. In Week 3, the students are asked to form groups for a team-based assessment task. You notice that some of the international students are struggling to form teams with the domestic students. This leaves them without a group.

__Extension:__ As part of the assessment task, students submitted a rating of peer contribution. These peer ratings affect the mark allocated to individuals within the group. You note that overall, the international students have consistently received much lower ratings than the domestic students.

## Scenario 2

It is week 4 of semester, your tutorials are running well, and your students are thoroughly engaged in the interactive group tasks that you use in each tutorial. However, one student is always late to the tutorials, which disrupts the class as you must repeat the lesson instructions. They tend not to engage in the tasks and don’t interact with the other students in their group.

 __Extension:__ You take the opportunity to have a chat with them after the week 4 tutorial. They share that they are autistic and have extreme anxiety. They arrive on time for the tutorial but then struggle to enter the room. They feel overwhelmed by the challenges of university.

## Scenario 3

You plan to discuss the changing roles of women in IT. As the topic might be challenging, you have included two 5-minute breaks in the hour-long tutorial to allow processing time and a break if the debate gets heated. Initially, the discussion goes well.​

Then, however, one student repeatedly expresses the opinion that women should not be working in the IT industry. You notice many of the female students progressively disengage from the discussion.​

__Extension:__ There is an assessment task requiring students to respond to statements related to gender roles in the IT industry in the LMS discussion forum. Over the weekend, the same student from the last scenario has written a lot of content that is sexist in content and aggressive in tone.

## Scenario 4

You are teaching in an undergraduate program. You have noticed a change in one of your students. Initially the student was showing up to tutorials on time, neat and tidy and engaged. It is now week 7 and they are arriving late, looking fatigued and not engaging much in tutorial activities.

 __Extension:__ You talk with the student after the tutorial and the student discloses to you that this is their first time living away from home which is a small town in far west NSW. They are feeling very isolated and sad. They have no family or friend support close by so spend a lot of time messaging and talking to their family and friends back home. They are considering not continuing with  uni  after this semester.

## Scenario 5

Your first class is set up and ready to go. To help you remember students’ names, you have printed name tags based on the class roll for correct spelling. One student has arrived early and told you that they hate to be identified by the legal name on their name tag. Other students are arriving, and the session starts in 2 minutes.

 __Extension:__ You wrote their preferred name on the back of the name tag and told the student that you would fix it for next week. During the class, the student is withdrawn and obviously not happy. After the class they disclose to you that they are transgender, and they are finding it difficult to have their name changed. The university bureaucracy is especially frustrating, given that the university says it is supportive of the LGBTQI+ community.
