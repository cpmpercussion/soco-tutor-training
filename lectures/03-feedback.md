## Plan for this session

In this session we will:

1. Understand a bit about the goals and design of assessments
2. Look at the features of effective feedback
3. Evaluate some different approaches to feedback
4. Look at how rubrics can support assessment

## Task: Worries and Questions (5mins)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
> What worries and questions do you have about feedback and marking?

Use the sticky notes from your table and answer these two questions:

1. What questions do you have about **feedback**?
2. What questions do you have about **marking**?

One question per sticky note! We will hear some together from each table.

<!-- ## Effective feedback

Can you think of an example of  **“good”**  feedback you have experienced as a learner?

**Consider the context, e.g.:**

- who
- what
- when
- where
- how
- why -->

## Task: Effective Feedback (5mins)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
By yourself, reflect on your experiences  _giving_  and  _receiving_ learning feedback. _What does effective feedback look like?_

Individually write down 3 adjectives, one per sticky note: _Effective feedback should be…_

Share your 3 adjectives with your group and explain why you chose them.

We will make a big list together on PollEverywhere.

## Principles of effective feedback

![Aspects of feedback](img/M3_23.png){width=65%}

## Actionable

- Provides steps the student can take.
- Promotes learner autonomy.
- Is essential for active learning.
- Affects future performance (i.e. is future-focused).

## Constructive

- Focuses on strengths and areas for development.
- Is respectful of the student.
- Is objective and evidence-based.

## Ongoing

- Occurs across the semester.
- Guides students in their progress.
- Supports learning expectations.
- Maintains student engagement.

## Consistent

- Is maintained for all students, teams and the semester.
- Shows clear connection between feedback and marks.
- Is fair and equitable.

## Timely

- Is provided sooner rather than later.
- Respects students’ time and effort.
- Allows students the time to reflect, adjust and improve.

## User Friendly 

- Helps ensure comprehensibility and understandability.
- Ensures that feedback is relevant to learner.
- Enhances the impact of feedback.

## Transparent

- Is open and impartial.
- Demonstrates alignment between learning outcomes, feedback and marks.
- Advises clearly what and how to improve.

## Dialogic

- Provides opportunity to ask questions or clarify.
- Takes the form of a discussion with the student.
- Encourages active engagement with the feedback process.

## Goal Referenced

- Focused on specific goals and tasks.
- Clarifies expected standards or criteria for success.
- Is written with the student in mind.

## Applying the principles

Consider this approach below when providing feedback:

![](img/M3_34.png){width=25%}
![](img/M3_35.png){width=25%}
![](img/M3_36.png){width=25%}

You may also apply facilitation techniques where appropriate.

## Challenges with feedback

"But the tutor told me my project is _great_!"

- Managing time and resources for providing and following up on feedback
- Potential student over-reliance on teacher feedback
- Managing class sizes or marking loads
- Managing student expectations about feedback.
- Effectively tailoring feedback to learner needs
- Potential miscommunication or misunderstanding

What might you do to overcome or address these?

## Tips from a Convenor

Some students will attack feedback and use the content to appeal a grade.

- Know the ANU grading rubric (more later): don't write "excellent work" when it's at the credit level. A credit is "good".
- Write why the work was at the grade level, and what areas prevent it from being higher.
- If it's a fail, be clear: "This work does not meet our standards... (some parts) show developing understanding (these parts) could be improved".
- Always address the work, not the student.

**Be careful** about providing feedback in person (e.g., in labs) on assessment items outside of written communication. Students can (and do) use casual conversations as a basis for appeal.

## Takeaways

- Focus on the task, not the learner.
- Remain objective and measure the student’s work against the task objectives, marking criteria and standards.
- Ensure feedback is clear, specific and tailored to the learner.
- Avoid personalisation, e.g. "I..." and "you..." but also personally _judgemental_ and _emotive_ words.
- **Be careful** when discussing marking guidelines, systems, processes or organisation with students. Any student questions or concerns should go to convenors so that messaging is consistent.
- Encourage students to engage with feedback.

## Generative AI

Generative AI is a quickly and constantly evolving domain. 
Guidance, policies and practices are also changing in response.  
Here are some useful resources that are available now and relevant to your teaching.

- "AI Essentials" resources on the Learning & Teaching blog [https://learningandteaching.anu.edu.au/resource-collection/ai-essentials/](https://learningandteaching.anu.edu.au/resource-collection/ai-essentials/)
- ANU Library AI Guide[https://libguides.anu.edu.au/generative-ai](https://libguides.anu.edu.au/generative-ai)
- Academic Skills: Best practice when using generative AI[https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/best-practice-principles/best-practice-when-using](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/best-practice-principles/best-practice-when-using) -->

# Rubrics and Marking Criteria

<!-- ## Task: Talking about Rubrics (5mins)

Let's have a bit of a discussion:

- What do you know about rubrics or marking criteria?
- How would you find out the marking rubric for a task?
- How can/should students use rubrics?
- How can/should educators use rubrics? -->

## Rubrics

**Question:** Do you look at rubrics or marking criteria as a student? Do you know how to find them?

- Provide clear criteria for both student and marker.
- Allow consistency and clear feedback – where and how students can improve.
- Can be provide various levels of detail.
- Can be used before  **(preparation)** , during  **(production)**  and after  **(feedback, reflection, review and improvement)**

## Rubrics in the assessment process

- **Before assessment:**
  - Unpack what is required.
  - Understand expectations and approaches.
  - Focus learning and set goals.
- **During assessment:**
  - Students examine and evaluate own progress.
  - Teachers use rubrics as focal point for moderation (e.g., in a larger cohort)
- **After assessment:**
  - Give feedback against specified criteria.
  - Identify strengths and weaknesses and areas to improve
  - Understand the standards and how grades are allocated

<!-- ## Grade Level to Marks

Tip for marking from a rubric: Work out consistent marks for each grade level, e.g., for a criterion out of 10:

| Total | HD   | D   | CR | P   | N   |
|-------|------|-----|----|-----|-----|
| 10    | 8-10 | 7   | 6  | 5   | 0-4 |
| 5     | 4-5  | 3-4 | 3  | 2-3 | 0-2 |
| 4     | 4    | 3   | 2  | 2   | 0-1 |
| 2     | 2    | 2   | 1  | 1   | 0   | -->

## Takeaways

- Understand (and practice) the tools and approaches for feedback and marking expected in your School or College.
- Where possible, ask for guidance or an opportunity to work or mark as a team.
- Use available rubrics, criteria documents, task descriptions and standards.
- Attend any assessment orientation, benchmarking or moderation meetings organised for the team.
- Set a timer for each stage of the process and stick to it!
- Take regular breaks to avoid fatigue or getting stuck.
- Be selective, deliberate and learning-focused with your feedback.
- Be clear about your feedback _before_ assigning a grade or marks.
