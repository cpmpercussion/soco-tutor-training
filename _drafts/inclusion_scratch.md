# Facilitating discussion of challenging topics

## Challenging topics

Students typically may need to engage with topics, ideas and concepts that may be challenging, due to:

* polarised or strongly held  __opinions__  or  __ideologies__;
* __lived experience__  of traumatic events or unsafe environments;
* __strong emotions__  or even  __distress__  when engaging directly with this content;
* __prior interactions__  with the teaching staff or other students;
* feeling  __unfairly burdened__  by the expectation of representing a marginalised group(s).

## Challenging topics

__Discuss__:

* What value to students is there in discussing   challenging topics in the classroom?
* How does this help your students?

## Be aware of the difference between…

__Academic discomfort__: The intellectual challenge students experience when they engage with new, complex, or controversial ideas.

__Student distress__: Beyond an intellectual challenge, involving emotional or psychological strain that can hinder a student's ability to learn effectively.

## Promoting an environment for discussion

Consider how you can promote a safe and inclusive space in which challenging topics can be discussed.  

_How might you:_

  * Establish a safe and respectful learning environment?
  * Establish expectations and boundaries?
  * Prepare yourself?

## 1. Establish a safe and respectful learning environment

How would you __create a safe space__ where students feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or reprisal?

**Hint**: Where possible, plan to have highly challenging conversations later in the semester, when students have had the opportunity to develop rapport with one another.

Conduct a short, (e.g. 5-minute) check-in at the beginning of tutorials to see how students are feeling about their studies.

Actively model respect for differing perspectives in both asynchronous and synchronous discussions.

Explicitly invite dissenting views from students and model respectful engagement in the discussion. Take care not to single out specific students for dissenting views.

Use an interested and supportive tone when responding to a question, even if you feel that the question was overly simplistic or off topic. Seek clarification from the  student.

## 2. Establish expectations and boundaries

How would you  __ensure there is a mutual understanding__ around course content, student and staff behaviour, and any boundaries that exist?

__HINT: __ Ensure the students know what to do if academic discomfort becomes distress. This should include information about ANU support services.

Remind students of their responsibilities under the Student Code of Conduct.

Establish clear guidelines and boundaries with the students for respecting perspectives and experiences during discussion, e.g. no interruptions, blame or inflammatory language;  use objective language etc.

Seriously consider points-of-view that differ from your current thinking and be open to changing your own perspectives based on what you learn from others.

Emphasise to the students the importance of active listening. One way to frame it is: “Listening and understanding is not the same as agreeing”. Being willing to listen and understand is how learning happens.

## 3. Prepare yourself

How could you prepare yourself for discussing difficult course topics, noting that sometimes unplanned discussions can also occur?

__HINT:__ Check in with your course convenor to ensure that you are adequately prepared and supported.

__The convenor will be able to give you:__   advance notice of the content, expectations around how that content will be managed, and direction to resources for maintaining your own and their students' wellbeing.

Consider how you might deal, emotionally and pedagogically, with potentially challenging topics. Consider how you would respond should you be asked for your view during a challenging discussion.

Think about the kind of behaviour you want to see from your students and how you might promote and model it.

Reflect upon your own preconceptions and assumptions of others.

Do not make assumptions about a student’s identity or to expect them to speak for an entire demographic, ethnic, religious or cultural group.

Speak to your convenor and other teaching staff in your course about how they are planning to approach challenging topics in their own courses.

## Key strategies for engaging with challenging topics.

1. Foster a respectful learning environment
2. Critically review your course content to ensure specific topics are essential to learning.
3. Prepare for and manage both planned and unplanned discussions on difficult topics.
4. Know about and refer students to support services.
5. Seek support for yourself, if necessary.

## Managing unplanned discussions

A suggested approach:

* Decide whether you are __willing to engage__  with the topic and if you are prepared emotionally and pedagogically to continue.
* If you do pursue a discussion, __set a time limit__  for the discussion, and then __look to the strategies provided__ previously for suggestions about facilitating the discussion.
* Be prepared to __step in proactively__ to protect students from inappropriate behaviour from other students using techniques provided above.

## Key stages when managing class discussions

1. Setting the scene
2. Before the discussion
3. During the discussion
4. After the discussion

We will explore a sample of these ideas now. 

## Stage 1: Setting the scene

__From the beginning of semester...__

Convenor responsibilities: 

- Be transparent about course content and activities.
- Identify where topics are optional

Convenor and tutor responsibilities:

- Establish a safe and respectful learning environment.
- Establish expectations and boundaries.
- Prepare yourself.

## Your responsibilities and limitations

ANU academic and professional staff are not expected to, nor should they, provide counselling, except where they are employed for that specific purpose.

* Know your boundaries
* Consult your convenor
* Refer to experts and professionals
* [Review the ANU Policy: Support for students](https://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_7742264)

# Creating inclusive learning communities

## Creating an inclusive space

_Reflect:_

> "You can have accessibility without inclusion, but not inclusion without accessibility."

## The elements of an inclusive space

Inclusive education facilitates the access, participation and success of students.

- Use inclusive language, including respect for choice.
- Allow for individual differences in how students want to access materials and participate in activities.
- Provide accessible materials, content and environments.
- Ensure students can see themselves reflected in materials and activities.

## Creating your own inclusive space

Think-Pair-Share:

- Suggest 1--3 practical changes to content, materials and activities to promote inclusion. 
- Be as specific as you can.
- Think and write each idea on a separate sticky note.
- Share your ideas with your partner.
- Place on the appropriate sheets around the room.

__Think about:__

When teaching, where could you provide diverse representation in your course materials?

How can you ensure your students can see themselves in the materials?
