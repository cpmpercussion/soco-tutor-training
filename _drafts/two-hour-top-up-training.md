This session is a top-up training session designed for tutors at the ANU School of Computing.

If you're coming to this session, you have been a tutor for a while (at least one semester over a one-year period). You've taught classes, helped students, probably learned a few things, had a few successes, and seen some challenges.

Rather than delivering information to you, this session is focussed on reflection. We want to elicit information from you about your experiences as a tutor, and connect you with your peers from across the School of Computing. By sharing our successes, challenges, and questions we can build a stronger community of teaching practice and connect everybody with resources to help where its needed.
