_this is for tutors who were not able to attend our main training session_

This catch-up traiing session will go through some of the crucial information that you need before starting as a tutor in the School of Computing.

Before you attend, you will have some to do, reviewing notes form the session, and choosing a focus for developing your teaching practice this semester.

In the session we will discuss your teaching focus with the other tutors and put together strong strategies to meet your goals.

Please note: this session is invite-only for tutors who cannot attend our main training session and have approval from the Associate Director Education to take a catch-up session instead. All tutors in our School must have completed introductory pedagogical training or hold a PhD in computing or a cognate field.
