abstract = {Universal design (UD), a concept that grew from the field of architecture, has recently emerged as a paradigm for designing instructional methods, curriculum, and assessments that are welcoming and accessible to students with a wide range of characteristics, including those related to race, ethnicity, native language, gender, age, and disability. This proactive approach holds promise for more fully including underrepresented groups in computing studies and for decreasing the need, and thus costs, for academic accommodations for students with disabilities. This article summarizes the history and development of UD, references research and practices that support the UD approach, provides examples of the strategies that apply UD to instruction and assessment, and recommends topics for future research. Although the application of UD to teaching and learning is in its infancy, the potential of UD to improve computing instruction should not be ignored. Further research could test the efficacy of specific UD practices in promoting learning in computing fields.},

abstract = {Creating inclusive learning environments is important for retaining students, particularly those from historically marginalized groups in computing. However, both faculty and graduate students -- who are responsible for teaching and mentoring activities - often receive little, if any, training on creating inclusive learning environments. Using a higher education approach, I developed and taught a semester-long course to prepare future faculty members to create inclusive computing learning environments. This experience report describes the process for creating the course including topics, readings, assignments, and approaches for facilitation and learning. I also provide analysis, reflection, and insights from students' surveys and their written reflections throughout the course. The primary contribution of this experience report is to document the learning gains in graduate students' self-efficacy, awareness, and preparation for faculty roles, and to share insights on the implementation of the course to serve as a guide for other departments in the development and execution of similar training approaches.},
