  abstract   = {Universal design (UD), a concept that grew from the field of architecture, has recently emerged as a paradigm for designing instructional methods, curriculum, and assessments that are welcoming and accessible to students with a wide range of characteristics, including those related to race, ethnicity, native language, gender, age, and disability. This proactive approach holds promise for more fully including underrepresented groups in computing studies and for decreasing the need, and thus costs, for academic accommodations for students with disabilities. This article summarizes the history and development of UD, references research and practices that support the UD approach, provides examples of the strategies that apply UD to instruction and assessment, and recommends topics for future research. Although the application of UD to teaching and learning is in its infancy, the potential of UD to improve computing instruction should not be ignored. Further research could test the efficacy of specific UD practices in promoting learning in computing fields.},

  abstract  = {Industry demand for software developers with knowledge of accessibility has increased substantially in recent years. However, there is little knowledge about the prevalence of higher education teaching about accessibility or faculty's perceived barriers to teaching accessibility. To address this gap, we surveyed 14,176 computing and information science faculty in the United States. We received a representative sample of at least one response from 318 of the 352 institutions we surveyed, totaling 1,857 responses. We found that 175 institutions (50\%) had at least one instructor teaching accessibility and that no fewer than 2.5\% of faculty overall teach accessibility. Faculty that teach accessibility are twice as likely to be female, to have expertise in HCI and software engineering, and to know people with disabilities. The most critical barriers to teaching accessibility that faculty reported were the absence of clear and discipline-specific accessibility learning objectives and the lack of faculty knowledge about accessibility. Faculty desired resources that were specific to the areas of computing in which they teach rather than general accessibility resources and guidelines.},

  abstract  = {Creating inclusive learning environments is important for retaining students, particularly those from historically marginalized groups in computing. However, both faculty and graduate students -- who are responsible for teaching and mentoring activities - often receive little, if any, training on creating inclusive learning environments. Using a higher education approach, I developed and taught a semester-long course to prepare future faculty members to create inclusive computing learning environments. This experience report describes the process for creating the course including topics, readings, assignments, and approaches for facilitation and learning. I also provide analysis, reflection, and insights from students' surveys and their written reflections throughout the course. The primary contribution of this experience report is to document the learning gains in graduate students' self-efficacy, awareness, and preparation for faculty roles, and to share insights on the implementation of the course to serve as a guide for other departments in the development and execution of similar training approaches.},
